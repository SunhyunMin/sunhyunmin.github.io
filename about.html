<h2 style="font-weight: bold;">Sunhyun Min</h2>
When I was young, I discovered my ability to improvise music, which naturally sparked my curiosity about cognitive processes: How can I improvise even when I am not consciously thinking about it? How do physical signals, like instrumental sounds, evoke emotions? Studying music and psychology only deepened these questions: If dissonances are innately unpleasant, how can we enjoy contemporary or jazz music? Or perhaps, it is not innate?

<h2 style="font-weight: bold;">MusIc N Cognition</h2>
Some may question researching music cognition since it isn't medical or survival-related. However, this makes it even more intriguing. Despite not being essential for survival, music is omnipresent. This is precisely why I am passionate about exploring music and cognition.

<h2 style="font-weight: bold;">Sprouting More Ideas with Novelties</h2>
I'm conducting a simultaneous EEG-fMRI music project in BST Lab(https://moonbrainlab.org). Yet, I have many more ideas. As an undergraduate, I studied social psychology, criminal psychology, and more as a member of a psychology academic club. Currently, I am broadening my perspectives by studying neuroscience. Additionally, as previously mentioned, my music background gives me unique insights. I am moving forward with numerous curiosities and hypotheses that I want to test.
